### Sales Data Analysis using Excel üßÆ

This Excel-based project analyzes sales data to generate insights around revenue, trends, and performance using built-in Excel features and macros. The .xlsm file contains data, computations, dashboards, and possibly VBA macros.

## üìã Project Summary

File: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OsNrOplDecTlXikSWyiVghg_eyaUySRO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103253472422656425300&rtpof=true&sd=true]

Purpose: To analyze and visualize sales data, derive trends, compare performance across categories/time periods, and support decision making.

* Tools used:

  * Excel sheets (tables, formulas)
  * PivotTables & PivotCharts
  * Conditional formatting
  * macros for automation

## üß≠ Features & Workflow

1. Raw Data Sheet

2. Data Preprocessing / Cleaning

  * Handling missing or incorrect values
  * Filtering, sorting, categorizing
    
3. Pivot Tables & Summaries
  * Summarizing sales by region, product category, month, etc.
  * Comparative metrics (YoY growth, month-over-month)

4. Charts / Visual Dashboards

  * Bar charts, line charts showing revenue trends
  * Pie charts or stacked charts for product/region share
  * Conditional formatting to highlight highs/lows

5. Automation / Macros

üìÇ How to Use / Explore

** 1. Download the .xlsm file:
[bhavesh(excel_project).xlsm][https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OsNrOplDecTlXikSWyiVghg_eyaUySRO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103253472422656425300&rtpof=true&sd=true]
 
** 2. Open with Microsoft Excel (desktop version) ‚Äî macro-enabled works best.

** 3. Enable macros if prompted (for full functionality).

** 4. Explore the different sheets:

  * Raw Data (or similar)

  * Analysis / Summary / Dashboard sheets

  * Use filters, slicers, pivot controls

# 5. (If macros present) Use buttons or menu items to run automated tasks like refresh or report generation.

# üéØ Insights (Expected / Sample)

  * Top-performing products or regions

  * Seasonal trends (which months have higher sales)

  * Year-over-year or month-over-month growth

  * Underperforming categories / potential focus areas

# üõ† Tips & Notes

  * Be cautious when running macros ‚Äî always keep a backup.

  * If data is large, Excel performance may slow; consider splitting or optimizing.

  * Ensure consistency of data formats (dates, numbers) to avoid pivot/chart errors.

  * Document any custom VBA code so future users understand it.
